# Problem Solving Tools

## Problem Solving
➡️ Problem solving in programming is the process of analyzing a problem, designing appropriate algorithms to solve it, and then implementing these algorithms using a programming language to create a program that achieves the desired result.

## Steps — Problem Solving
1. Determine your problem.  
2. **Decomposition**
   ➡️ Break a complex problem down into smaller, more easily solved problems.

### How do I use it?
- Define the main tasks in your project.
- Divide each task into smaller subtasks.
- Continue breaking it down until each task is directly executable.

**Example:**  
➡️ For a store management program: Divide it into: *Product Management*, *Customer Management*, *Sales Management*.  
    Divide Product Management into: Add Product, Delete Product, Edit Product.

---

## Algorithmic Thinking
➡️ After you divided tasks to subtasks you design a series of logical steps to solve it.

### How do I use it?
- Start by defining the required inputs and outputs.
- Think about the steps necessary to transform the inputs into outputs.

---

## Abstraction
➡️ Focus on only the necessary information and ignore the unimportant details.

---

## Debugging
➡️ The process of identifying and fixing errors in code.

---

## Tools
➡️ Common tools and aids used during problem solving:
- Flowcharts
- Pseudocode
- Debuggers / breakpoints
- Unit tests
- Print/log statements

---

## Flowchart symbols
➡️ Types of boxes used to make a flowchart (common examples):

- **Oval** → Start / End  
- **Rectangle** → Process  
- **Diamond** → Decision  
- **Parallelogram** → Input/Output  
- **Circle** → Connector
